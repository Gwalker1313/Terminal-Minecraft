# Terminal-Raytracer
An extremely primitive voxel world rendered using DDA raytracing in a terminal via ASCII.

Movement: WASD

Vision: IJKL

NOTE: if the terminal is failing to render the world (i.e. looks like a jumble of ASCII) zoom out to the second farthest option in your terminal and reload via either "CTRL+L" or "CMD+L".
